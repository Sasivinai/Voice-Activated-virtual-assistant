# Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

A customizable voice-activated virtual assistant built with Python, leveraging artificial intelligence and speech technologies to perform various tasks via spoken commands.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a **Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant** capable of understanding natural language commands, executing actions like opening applications or performing web searches, and responding with speech.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In a fast-paced digital world, traditional input methods (typing, clicking) can be inefficient or inaccessible. Existing commercial assistants often lack customization, pose data privacy concerns, or require constant internet access.

This project aims to create a **lightweight, customizable, and privacy-friendly** virtual assistant that works in real-time environments and performs daily tasks through voice interaction.
